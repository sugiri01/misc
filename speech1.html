      <p class="mb-6">Good [morning/afternoon], everyone! I'm Aditi, a 7th grader, and today I'm going to talk about something that might surprise you. It's something that makes our palms sweaty, our hearts race, and maybe even makes us want to hide under our desks. I'm talking about failure. (Pause for dramatic effect.) Yes, that scary word we all try to avoid. But here's the thing: failure isn't the enemy. In fact, failing might just be the best thing that can happen to us!</p>
      <p class="mb-6">Before we dive in, I want you to do something for me. Close your eyes for a moment. Now, raise your hand if you've failed at something this week. Maybe you got a bad grade on a test, missed a goal in soccer, or forgot your lines in the school play. Keep your hands up and open your eyes. Look around. (Pause)</p>
      <p class="mb-6">Isn't that amazing? Almost everyone has their hand up, including me! Now, here's something that might blow your mind: according to a study, we fail 70% of the time when learning a new skill. That's right, 70%! But here's the cool part - those who embrace these failures are 23% more likely to succeed in the long run.</p>

      <p class="mb-4 text-lg">[AGD: Interactive poll with school-related examples]</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Let's do a quick poll. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being "I love failing" and 5 being "Failure terrifies me," how would you rate your relationship with failure? Think about it for a second. Maybe you're thinking about that upcoming math test or the science fair project you're working on. Now, raise your hand when I call out your number. (Conduct the poll)</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Wow, interesting results! It looks like many of us are still pretty scared of failure. I get it. I used to be terrified of failing too. Last year, when I tried out for the school band and didn't make it, I felt like crawling under a rock and never coming out. But you know what? That failure taught me something important, and I'm going to share that with you today.</p>

      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">[AGD: Personal anecdote]</p>
      <p class="mb-6">Remember when I mentioned not making it into the school band? Well, at first, I was devastated. But then I realized something: that failure taught me more than success ever could. I learned that I needed to practice more, that I had to work on my rhythm, and most importantly, that I shouldn't give up just because things didn't go my way the first time.</p>
      <p class="mb-6">Think about it: when everything goes perfectly, what do we learn? Not much! We just think, "Wow, I'm amazing," and move on. But when we fail, we're forced to figure out what went wrong, and more importantly, how to fix it. Failure pushes us to improve, to get better, and to try again. It's like a cheat code for leveling up in real life!</p>
      <blockquote class="bg-blue-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-blue-700 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="italic">Take Thomas Edison, for example. He failed over 1,000 times before inventing the light bulb. Can you imagine failing that many times on a science project? Most of us would have given up after the first few tries! But Edison saw each failure as a step toward success. He said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." And guess what? Without all those failures, we'd still be doing our homework by candlelight!</p>

      <p class="mb-4 text-lg">[AGD: Interactive exercise]</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Now, let's talk about resilience. It's like a superpower that helps us bounce back when things go wrong. And you know what builds resilience? You guessed it - failure!</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Let's try a quick experiment. I need a volunteer. (Select a volunteer) I'm going to show you a series of patterns, and I want you to try to guess the next one in the sequence. (Show a few simple patterns, then a more complex one that the volunteer is likely to get wrong)</p>
      <p class="mb-6">Thank you! Now, here's the cool part. When our volunteer got the complex pattern wrong, their brain did something amazing. It released a chemical that helps create new connections in the brain. Basically, their brain just grew!</p>
      <blockquote class="bg-blue-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-blue-700 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="italic">But failure doesn't just make us more resilient - it makes us more creative too. Did you know that Post-it Notes were created by accident? A scientist was trying to make super strong glue, but he ended up with weak glue instead. At first, he thought he had failed. But then he realized this "failure" could be used to make sticky notes that don't leave marks. And now, we use them for everything from study notes to reminders on our lockers!</p>

  <!-- Strategies for Embracing Failure Section -->

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-6 border-b-2 border-blue-200 pb-2">Strategies for Embracing Failure (2 minutes)</h3>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">[AGD: Relatable examples for school kids]</p>
      <p class="mb-6">So, how can we start embracing failure? Here are some ideas that have helped me:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-8 text-blue-700 space-y-4">
        <li class="text-lg">Keep a "failure journal": Write down your failures and what you learned from them. I started doing this after my band tryout, and it's amazing to see how much I've grown!</li>
        <li class="text-lg">Celebrate "failing forward": Reward yourself for failures that taught you something. Maybe you failed a math test, but you learned which topics you need to study more. That's worth celebrating!</li>
        <li class="text-lg">Practice "micro-failures": Try small challenges where it's okay to fail. For example, try learning a new word every day. If you forget it, no big deal! You're still training your brain to embrace challenges.</li>
        <li class="text-lg">Share your failures: Tell your friends or family about your failures. It might feel scary at first, but it helps you realize that everyone fails sometimes. Plus, your friends might have great advice!</li>
      </ul>

  <!-- The Hidden Benefits of Failure Section -->

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-6 border-b-2 border-blue-200 pb-2">The Hidden Benefits of Failure (2 minutes)</h3>
      <p class="mb-4 text-lg">[AGD: Surprising fact relevant to students]</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Now, here's something that might surprise you. Did you know that many successful people failed in school? Albert Einstein's teachers thought he was "stupid." Walt Disney was fired from a newspaper for "lacking imagination." J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book was rejected by 12 publishers!</p>
      <p class="mb-6">These people didn't let failure stop them. Instead, they used it as fuel to keep going. Failure taught them three important things:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-8 text-blue-700 space-y-4">
        <li class="text-lg">Resilience: The ability to bounce back when things go wrong.</li>
        <li class="text-lg">Creativity: The power to find new solutions to problems.</li>
        <li class="text-lg">Humility: The wisdom to know that we don't know everything.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-6">These skills are like superpowers in school and in life. They're what helped me improve my grades after a tough semester, and what pushed me to try out for the debate team even though public speaking used to terrify me.</p>

      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">[AGD: Call to action and memorable quote]</p>
      <p class="mb-6">So, here's my challenge to you. This week, I want you to fail at something. Try out for a team, even if you're not sure you'll make it. Raise your hand in class, even if you're not 100% sure of the answer. Take on a tough project, even if you're scared you might not get an A+. And when you fail - because you will fail - I want you to celebrate.</p>
